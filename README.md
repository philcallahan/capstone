* The bulk of the analysis was performed using the notebook orutil_tool_redacted.ipynb as the master file which pulled functions from orutil_redacted.py.
* To create visuals that with too little k-anonymization (too granular) hypothetical data was generated. It was created with Mockups.xlsx which was pasted into the notebook orutil_hypothetical_data.ipynb and used some actual functions from orutil_redacted.py to generate graphs and dictionaries like the real analysis did.
